### Shri Rama's sons chant the poem

While Shri Rama was still King of Ayodhya, the great Sage Valmiki composed this beautiful classic.

The holy rishi composed twenty-four thousand verses and divided them into five hundred chapters and six books. In addition, he composed the epilogue. The work being completed, he reflected thus: "To whom shall I teach this classic?"

While the sage was reflecting on the matter, the two princes, Kusha and Lava, the offspring of Rama and Sita approached bim and touched his feet in reverence. The great sage studied these two virtuous princes of mellifluous speech, who dwelt with him in his hermitage at that time. Knowing them to be wise and full of faith in the teachings of the Vedas, the great sage, who had expounded the meaning of the scriptures in his verses, taught the classic to them.

The great Valmiki taught them the classic describing the deeds of Rama and Sita and all that relates to the incidents leading to the slaying of Ravana named "The Slaying of the Grandson of Poulastya [[1]]()". This historical classic is pleasant to sing and adopted to the three measures of time [[2]](), it is contained within the seven notes and can be sung to the vina. It expresses the various moods of love, courage, disgust, anger, terror, compassion, wonder, laughter and serenity.

The two princes were skilled musicians, proficient in rhythm and melody and had sweet voices; they were as comely to look at as Gandharvas [[3]](). Endowed with god-like beauty, the two sweet singers, the reflected images of Shri Rama himself, constantly repeated the holy classic and commited it to memory. The two adorable and charming princes skilfully recited the holy classic, the Ramayana, which extols virtue, before the sages, the learned brahmins and the ascetics, as they had been instructed to do.

On a particular occasion, the two princes, great-souled, fortunate, and equipped with all good qualities, chanted the great epic in Shri Rama's assembly. The listening sages were visibly moved and shed tears of delight. Being overcome with wonder, they cried "Excellent! Excellent", and praising the two singers, the virtue-loving sages experienced great joy. Showering praises on the brothers, they cried, "How melodiously you sing! How exquisite is the divine poem, the story of Rama!"

Being pleased with the sweet singers, one sage presented them with loshtas, another with delicious fruits, a third with robes of bark and another with antelope skins; some gave sacrificial thread, some vessels for collecting alms, others gave loin cloths, kusha grass, garments of yellow cloth, scarves and thread for binding the hair, sacrificial vessels, rosaries and axes. Others bestowed their blessings upon them, saying "May you live long" and all acclaimed the author of the marvellous poem.

They said: "This metre will be the foundation of the verse of future poets; it is composed according to specific rules; the two princes have sung this wonderful poem with great art; it will promote wisdom in those who listen to it and grant them longevity and health; it is truly able to charm the heart."

While the sages were thus praising the two princes, Shri Ramachandra, passing that way, took them to his royal palace. Occupying his golden throne, Shri Rama, the destroyer of his foes, offered hospitality and reverence to the two worthy princes. In the assembly, surrounded by his ministers and brothers, Shri Rama looked approvingly on those handsome and learned youths, and addressed the Princes Lakshmana, Shatrughna and Bharata saying: "Hear the historical poem, which these two celestial and brilliant minstrels sing, this poem which portrays incidents of wonderful meaning."

Then Shri Rama commanded the two musicians to sing and the princes tuned their vinas and chanted the poem they had learned, sweetly and clearly. The whole assembly listened to the music which was wholly gratifying to the mind and heart. Shri Rama said: " I admire the music and the verse sung by these two minstrels who appear to be endowed with royal attributes."

In this way, praised and encouraged by Shri Ramachandra, the two brothers demonstrating their skill in music, sang on. Listening to them in the royal assembly, Shri Ramachandra was charmed.
