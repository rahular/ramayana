### The administration of the kingdom

Ever devoted to the welfare of King Dasaratha, the ministers of the House of Ikshwaku were possessed of all the virtues; their counsels were based on truth and they understood the import of the royal commands immediately.

Eight of the king's counsellors were famed; untiringly employed in the affairs of state, they were honest and devoted to the cultivation of virtue. Their names were Dhristi, Jayanta, Vijaya, Siddhartha, Atyartha-Sadaka, Ashoka, Mantra-pala and Sumantra.

The great and holy sages, Vasishtha and Vamadeva assisted the king in his observance of spiritual duties and also acted as his advisers.

All the ministers were virtuous, scorning to do wrong, benevolent, versed in the moral law, of wide experience, disinterested, magnanimous, acquainted with the spirit of the scriptures, forbearing, patient, obedient to the king, true to their word, cheerful, free from avarice and well acquainted with the affairs of their fellow subjects and with those of the subjects of other monarchs. They were efficient, firm in friendship, and even passed judgment on their own sons if they broke the law.

These counsellors were expert in the science of economics and warfare, and never inflicted unmerited punishment on an enemy. They were brave and unambitious. Conversant with every branch of political life, they protected all those who lived in the state. Adding to the royal treasury without burdening the learned and the warriors, they inflicted penalties on wrongdoers with due regard to their capacity for hearing it. These ministers were pure of heart and of chaste conduct. None consorted with his neighbour's wife, none were wicked and all lived together peaceably. Cultivating every good quality and practising the various arts, they were renowned for their courage, their fair name was published abroad and their lives were guided by reason. Skilled in the laws of the country and blessed with wealth, they issued wise edicts and exercised their minds in philosophical debate.

Acquainted with the moral code, they conversed affectionately with each other; such were King Dasaratha's ministers who, informed by their agents of the needs of the people, satisfied them and governed with prudence.

In the administration of his kingdom, the king never permitted unrighteousness to cause dissension, and became known throughout the world as an ocean of truth. That lion among men King Dasaratha, reigning over the earth, had none superior or equal to himself. Honoured by his feudal lords, surrounded by friends, King Dasaratha, like Indra, reigned in majesty. Benevolent, powerful, accomplished and gracious, King Dasaratha protected Ayodhya and shone in splendour like the sun illumining the world.
