### The king desires to perform a sacrifice for the birth of a son

King Dasaratha, that glorious and righteous king, though performing great austerities, was without an heir to the throne. Then the wise and great-souled monarch said to himself: "I will perform the horse-sacrifice (Aswa-medha)[[1]]() in order to have a son."

Having thus decided, the supremely sagacious sovereign convened a meeting of his counsellors and addressing his chief minister, Sumantra, commanded him as follows: "Send speedily for the spiritual preceptors and priests." Quick to act, Sumantra at once summoned those highly learned preceptors and brought thither Suyagna, Vamadeva, Javali, Kasyapa and Vasishtha together with other eminent priests and brahmins.

Having offered salutations to these holy men, King Dasaratha, speaking in gracious accents, uttered words full of truth and purpose: He said, "O Sages, I have practised virtue and yet I have not had the good fortune to be blessed with a son; it is therefore my intention to perform the horse-sacrifice. I wish to act according to the injunction. of the scriptures; you, O Holy Men, advise me after due deliberation as to how I can be successful in the proposed undertaking".

The learned brahmins, led by Shri Vasishtha, praised the king's intention and said: "Thou hast decided on the proper course, O King." Highly pleased, they commanded those things requisite for the sacrifice to be assembled and the horse loosed. They said, "O King, let a place of sacrifice be chosen on the north bank of the river Sarayu. O King, this holy resolve formed by thee, for the sake of an heir, will assuredly bring the fulfilment of thy desire ".

Hearing the words of the brahmins, the monarch rejoiced and commanded his ministers to bring the sacrificial appointments and release the horse under the protection of the warriors;[[1]]() they were also directed to erect a sacrificial pavilion on the bank of the river Sarayu. He further decreed the adoption of those measures which would diminish the possibility of hindrance to the sacrifice, for even for kings, the horse-sacrifice was not easily performed.

The king said: " Let it be remembered that during the observance of the sacrifice, no suffering must be inflicted on any, lest some perverse and crafty brahmin should cause obstruction in the proceedings. By carrying through the ritual without regard for scriptural injunctions, it comes to naught; therefore, bring the sacrifice to a successful conclusion. I depend on you, and expect you to carry the sacrifice through to a successful issue."

The counsellors replied, saying, "O King, be it so". Blessing the monarch, the learned brahmins retired, and the king addressed his ministers saying: "Prepare the sacrifice as the officiating priests have instructed you and accept responsibility for its final success."

Then the illustrious sovereign left the court and entered his private apartments where the queens dwelt, who loved the king from the depths of their hearts.

King Dasaratha addressed them, saying: " I intend to observe a sacrifice for the sake of obtaining a son, do you all follow the prescribed discipline." The queens rejoiced to hear these words from the lips of the king and their lotus-like faces brightened like flowers on the departure of the cold season.

1. Aswa-Medha. A sacrifice, which in Vedic times was performed by kings. A horse, being consecrated by certain ceremonies, was let loose and allowed to wander at will followed by warriors; the ruler of any country the animal entered was bound to fight or submit; finally the horse was sacrificed with special rites.
